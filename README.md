# racket-alexis [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lexi-lambda/racket-alexis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lexi-lambda/racket-alexis) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/lexi-lambda/racket-alexis/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/lexi-lambda/racket-alexis?branch=master)

This is a collection of utilities I’ve found useful while working with Racket. The current list of packages included in this repository is as follows (with links to documentation):

- [`alexis-util`](http://pkg-build.racket-lang.org/doc/alexis-util/) — A set of various odds and ends that I’ve found helpful, primarily in the form of generalized macros and shortcut forms. Consult the documentation for a full listing.

- [`alexis-multicast`](http://pkg-build.racket-lang.org/doc/alexis-multicast/) — An implementation of “multicast async channels”. Like `racket/async-channel`, but with support for one-to-many broadcasts of messages.
